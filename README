  E Plugin for CakePHP


  ---- Queue is a CakePHP plugin for interfacing with beanstalkd, a fast,
       distributed, in-memory workqueue service.

  Synopsis
  --------
  This plugin was started with the idea that it may become a place for
  classes connecting to various kinds[1] of queues. However since ages there
  has support for beanstalkd only, which is a fantastic queue btw.

  Other notes
  -----
  The stream_get_line function is bugged in PHP 5.3.10, which is unfortunately
  the version that Ubuntu 12.04 LTS ships with.
  This function is used in the _read() function of Lib/BeanstalkdSocket.php,
  so as a workaround you can replace that line with these:
  {{{
      $data = fgets($this->_connection, 16384);
      $packet = rtrim($data, "\r\n");
  }}}
